  <center> <em> <h3> By Simran Rao <h3> </em> </center>

<center> <em> SR:What instruments do you play? </em> </center> <br>
<center> SS: So, I’ve been playing the guitar since I was 12 and um, it's been quite a journey since then. <br>
 When I started out I knew that I had an interest in music because I like to sing, <br>
 but having an instrument supporting my singing made it a whole performance by itself. </center> <br>

 <center> <em>SR: What kind of guitars do you play? </em> </center> <br>
 <center> SS: So, I’m more comfortable with the acoustic but I can also play the electric. </center> <br>

 <center> <em> SR: How come the acoustic?</em> </center> <br>
<center> SS: I like the acoustic number one because it's handy, you don’t need to connect it to speakers.<br>
You don’t need to mess much with the settings of the crunch and the base.<br>
I started out with acoustic because thats what beginners start with and I like the sound of the acoustic <br>
because thats what I like listening to over the electric. As I progressed in my academics in the guitar<br>
I had to switch to the electric at some point because I was giving exams for <a href="http://royaltrinityschoolofmusic.com/">Trinity</a>.
</center> <br>

<center> <em> SR: Oh? What level have you reached in Trinity? </em> </center> <br>
<center> SS: Trinity-I just reached a level four because I didn’t want to give exams after that,<br>
 then my focus would be on exams and not playing for fun. Throughout the 11th and 12th grade<br>
 I didn’t play much of it. I played it only when I wanted to. Then when I came to New York I was <br>
like, ok I might not play it that much but I might as well take my guitar there,<br>
what is it going to do it home? Then my roommate came up with an idea of performing at Birds Cafe.<br>
It was a freestyle singing do-your-thing, poetry, instrument kind of event-open mic.<br>
I played '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=namFjcOgHSE">Valerie</a>' by Amy Winehouse on the guitar and she sang it.</center> <br>

<center> <em> SR: What that your favorite moment playing the guitar?</em> </center> <br>
<center> SS: No, my favorite would be when I was playing at school for graduation.<br>
I was singing my farewell songs and I played and it was very emotional. <br>
As for New York, I still have to have more experiences.</center> <br>

<center> <em> SR: What was your favorite song to play on the guitar?</em> </center>
<center> SS: 'Hero’ by Enrique Iglesias.</center> <br>

<center> <em> SR: Have you ever wanted to play any other instruments?</em> </center> <br>
 <center> SS: Ok, so like every other Indian kid I started out with the keyboard.<br>
 My first keyboard was the Yamaha-I forgot the number next to it.<br>
 The first song I learned on it was 'Happy Birthday;, then 'Doe a Deer' and then 'Jana Gana Mana',<br>
 the National Anthem of India, and I somehow lost interest in the keyboard. </center> <br>

<center> <em> SR: How old were you? </em> </center> <br>
<center> SS: I was six. Thats when I realized keyboard isn’t for me, I have a different calling maybe.</center> <br>

<center> <em> SR: What songs do you usually play?</em> </center> <br>

<center> SS: I usually play pop songs that have similar repetitive cords, because that's easy to grasp on to. <br>
If I have to learn a song it's usually via Youtube. <br>
The pop songs have the same form <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"> chord progression </a> which is A,G,B,F Minor and B Minor.<br>
 Most of these chords are there in pretty much every song. <br>
 The string movement it different for each of them, but the pattern it somewhat similar. <br>
 The first song I actually learned how to play was 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams' by Greenday. <br>
 Interestingly enough, what I found really hard was singing and playing at the same time.<br>
 You have to be really fluid, it has to come from the back of your head, <br>
 like you don’t have to think about the next chord. It has to be muscle movement.<br> </center>
